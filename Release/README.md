## APP - Advanced Picks and 'Poons

This is a utility mod that adds (currently) 2 tiers of 3 new items. Mining Picks, Fishing Harpoons, and Harvesting Sickles.

These are designed to be balanced and will require the player to seek out acquiring the tools. I will add hints to the bottom of this file for help getting started as well as spoiler information giving the nuts and bolts of the mod.

## Latest updates

### 0.9.1 Initial Release
First release includes the Advanced and Expert versions of Pick, 'Poon, and Sickle. 

## Shout-outs
This was my first mod for Outward. I have a lot of experience with Unity and C# and modding games in the past. This was a wholly different experience and I couldn't have done it without the whole community on the Outward Modding Community Discord. I want to specifically thank:

 - Emo - My Outward-specific code guru. Easily 10% of my code is
   essentially his.
 - Faeryn - Another great coder that helped me.
 - IggyTheMad - Great modder and great community leader.
 - Vheos - Great modder with an excellent pack out there with pristine code.
 - Sinai - The godfather of Outward modding. We stand on his shoulders.
 - Dyskord - My buddy who convinced me to play Outward in the first
   place and a great gaming mind to help balance and test.

## TODO:
I hope to incorporate the 3rd tier of each tool. A master version that will require even more effort to acquire. I would also like to add more custom graphics, including tool models, down the line.

## Thank You
Thank you for checking out my humble first mod. Please feel free to report any issues or suggestions to me on the Outward Modding Community Discord server(https://discord.gg/zKyfGmy7TR). My channel is #gothiska-workshop.

## Basic Help:
In order to get an idea of what to do.. Speak with Loud-Hammer in Cierzo.

## Under the Hood:
Here are the details of how to acquire the tools and more specifics of the bonuses:
The smith in Cierzo will advise the player to seek out other blacksmiths. The blacksmiths in Berg, Levant, and Monsoon will have the recipe to craft the Advanced versions of the tools. The smith in Harmattan will have the Expert recipes. For now the caravanner in New Sirocco will have the Expert recipes as well(to be updated to the smith when I... reach that part of the game ;))

The Advanced versions add a flat 25% chance for an extra "roll" on harvesting from the node. This should in theory yield a second base ore/fish/plant any time it succeeds with the additional default rate for any extra items.

The Expert versions will do the same but at a 50% chance. 

When Master tier is added I aim for 75% and for acquiring these recipes to be more difficult(perhaps random drops) and/or a much deeper "chain-craft" to make them.
